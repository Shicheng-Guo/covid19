# PRS-PheWAS

We assessed association between blood measurement traits polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and i) infection disease risk, and ii) acute respiratory infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome, influenza and pneumonia hospitalization and death risk. We focused on 44 disease antigen measurements (listed in [`UKB_Category_1307.tsv`](UKB_Category_1307.tsv))[1], infectious diseases and acute respiratory infections (ICD-10 codes corresponding to J00-J06, J09-J18, J80, and J20-J22), and deaths in UK Biobank.

### Results files

- [`PRS_PheWAS.phenotypes.tsv`](PRS_PheWAS.phenotypes.tsv): the list of disease antigen phenotypes used in the study. It has sample size counts (`N`) across different population definitions in the Rivas Lab.
- [`phewas.white_british.summary.tsv`](phewas.white_british.summary.tsv): this table has the results for PRS-PheWAS across 44 disease antigens.
- [`phewas.white_british.icd.summary.tsv`](phewas.white_british.icd.summary.tsv): this table has the accosiaion results for the diseases and deaths of the infectious diseases and acute respiratory infections.
- [`PRS.icd.OR.summary.tsv`](PRS.icd.OR.summary.tsv): this table contains the odds ratio across PRS percentile bins computed for diseases and deaths of the infectious diseases and acute respiratory infections. The corresponding figures are in [`figs`](figs) directory.

### Scripts and notebook

- [`1_master_PRS_file.R`](1_master_PRS_file.R): this script combines the PRS files and prepare as a "master PRS" file.
- [`2_PRS_PheWAS_phenotype.ipynb`](2_PRS_PheWAS_phenotype.ipynb): from the list of UK Biobank Field IDs (listed in [`UKB_Category_1307.tsv`](UKB_Category_1307.tsv)), this script identifies the corresponding set of phenotypes and write it to a file ([`PRS_PheWAS.phenotypes.tsv`](PRS_PheWAS.phenotypes.tsv)).
- [`3_int_PheWAS_phenotypes.R`](3_int_PheWAS_phenotypes.R): this script applies the inverse-normal transformation to the phenotypes.
