# COVID-19 Host Genetics analysis

As a part of [COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://covid-19genehostinitiative.net/), we perform the following set of analyses to better understand the genetic basis of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

- [`UKB_HLA_freq`](/UKB_HLA_freq): HLA frequency in UK Biobank[1].
- [`snpnet`](/snpnet): Polygenic prediction of biomarkers and blood measurements. We deposit notebooks and scripts for polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis in this directory[2,3,4].

## Publicly available resources

- [HLA allelotype frequencies in UK Biobank](/UKB_HLA_freq)
- (New: 2020/3/19) [The weights for polygenic risk prediction](/snpnet)
  - The weights of PRSs are available at [Google Drive shared folder: https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_PRS_weights](https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_PRS_weights).
  - Please see the documentation in [`snpnet`](/snpnet) directory for more information.

## Update log

- 2020/3/20: We added a link to the [17th IHIW NGS HLA Data](http://17ihiw.org/17th-ihiw-ngs-hla-data/).
- 2020/3/19: We made an initial release of the polygenic risk score weights for 66 triats (blood measurements and biomarkers)! The weights of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are available at [Google Drive shared folder: https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_PRS_weights](https://bit.ly/rivas-lab_covid19_PRS_weights). Please see [`snpnet`](/snpnet) directory for more information. We are still running the PRS computations and we will make an update release when we have improved results.
- 2020/3/17: We updated the [HLA fequency reference](/UKB_HLA_freq). It now includes the frequencies from 5 population groups.
- 2020/3/17: initial release!
